  <div class="content"><p>Jesus washes away our transgressions. To put it more anecdotally, Jesus <em>scrubs</em> away my transgressions. Less of a bubble-bath and more of a grinding, painful cleansing of my sin. My skin has been made so thick that the sponge is not enough! Time to whip out the pumice stone and the steel wool pad to clean off all the crap I have accumulated.</p>

<p>I have been thinking lately of who I find myself to be while still living here on this earth. How can my relationship with Jesus be described? What properties make up this consistent dynamic of sin, repentance, hope and sanctification?</p>

<p>The term <em>weathered rebel</em> has been popping into my mind as of late. The human being stuck between the &ldquo;already&rdquo; and the &ldquo;not yet&rdquo;. The soul waiting in expectancy. The flesh giving God the finger. The heart disfigured; obsessing over the bloodguiltiness that has already been atoned for.</p>

<p>My flesh is being whittled down each day. By grace I am able to experience life in the most uncomfortably exciting ways I could never imagine. Keep scrubbing Jesus! The breeze feels so nice on the raw skin.</p>
