  <div class="content"><p>I took a wrong turn the other day; I wandered close to where I grew up.</p>

<p>My senses indulged themselves as a legion of chemicals rushed to my nucleus amygdalae. Childhood flowed steady like a drug in my veins. The instant flash of twelve years worth of memories running concurrently through my brain is overwhelming to say the least.</p>

<p><em>It hit me like a truck.</em></p>

<p>Getting shot and killed by fireworks with Nathan. Receiving sight to see leaves falling off of trees for the first time. Packing frozen juice boxes in preparation for long journeys in the woods where, regretfully, poison oak would get the best of some of us. The scuffs of black tar leftover from skateboards and rollerblades and titanium scooters and whatever else made us feel cool that summer.</p>

<p>I remember the day the birds were sold. The day the sidewalk go cut up and my mother gave away the Diet Coke. The day I found the girl next door&rsquo;s secret journal in which she called here mom a bitch.</p>

<p>Where is Nathan? Are frozen juice boxes still delicious? (edit: Yes!) Is the bitch-mom still a bitch? Whatever happened to the journeys in the woods? The sword fights and handball tournaments? Are we way too grown up to be pretending to be soldiers at war?</p>

<p><em>Is it offensive that a grown man would rather imagine fighting a war than actually fight in one?</em></p>

<p>These memories aren&rsquo;t Christmas, they aren&rsquo;t birthdays, and they&rsquo;re sure as hell not family tragedies. These days are the mundane. The boring. The always.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t relive shit like that. All I can do is poop out more of it. Hopefully less to indulge myself and more to glorify the one who puts it all into motion.</p>
